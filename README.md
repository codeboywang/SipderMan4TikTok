# SpiderMan
Now, Spider try to get some info from Tik Tok.
Using Selenium to control Chrome to load web, get html and grab infomation.
The tik tok didn't open any interface for PC device, so a fake header pretending as cell phone is needed.
Tik tok wouldn't response the whole html at once. There some js for changing elements in onriginal html, especially some stastics. That is why using Selenium.

# Using
Put video id in the video.txt, one for each line.
You can get video id by sharing the Video and openning by chrom. The video id is in the address.
You can program some kind of shortcut to get video id automaticly in your IOS.
